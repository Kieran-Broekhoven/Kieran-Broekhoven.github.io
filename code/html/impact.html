            <p>
                    A study done by  Nixon, Resick, and Nishith (2004) discovered  75% of domestic violence victims in 
                    their study were diagnosed with PTSD (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder). According to the Mayo Clinic,
                    PTSD is sparked by “exposure to an event that involved or held the threat of death, violence, or serious 
                    injury.”  According to the National Center on PTSD, due to women’s higher likelihood of experiencing 
                    trauma, including domestic violence.<br>

            <p>A 2005 national telephone poll of 1,200 working adults found that 64 percent of those who identified as 
               victims of domestic violence reported that their ability to work was affected by the violence. Constant 
               distraction and fear of abuser’s intrusions at work make it difficult for victims to concentrate and 
               perform their job duties. 12 Nearly all (96 percent) of 120 employed women IPV survivors surveyed by the Maine 
               Department of Labor indicated that abuse affected their performance and productivity, including being 
               constantly harassed at work, delayed getting to work, or prevented from going to work. As a result, 
               60 percent of victims in the study reported having either quit their job or being terminated as a result of 
               the abuse.</p>
